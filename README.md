# Solution to controll any fermenter remote via a webapplication

## General idea:

This is a prototype project of my idea to create a basic fermenter controller website, which can control any hooked-up device. For the system it doesn't matter how old or new a fermenter is. It just needs a Raspberry PI to connect the devices with a computer and access to the internet and it will be good to go.

## In dept review of a basic fermenter:

A fermenter is a common machine with a few controllers and devices attached to it. Fermenters al also called bioreactors which refers to their purpose. We call a device bioreactor, when inside of them, there is a biologically active environment, in which a chemical process is carried out involving organisms or biochemically active substance. (like enzymes)
The organisms inside of a bioreactor might have special needs. We must provide oxygen; therefore, we use submerged aerators. We need to provide and even distribution in our chamber and for that we mostly use an agitation system. (basically, some kind of rotor in the fluid) There are some examples for fermenters which use the aerator system to create flow inside, but these are used in special scenarios.
Now that we have oxygen provided, organisms can grow and work inside. Every organism has its own thermo and pH optimum where they are the most effective. To maximize their productivity, we need to provide and keep the best conditions for them. To control the pH in the reactor area we can add base or acid to the fluid. Bioreactors commonly use dual layer chambers. Between the layers we can circulate water and with it, we can adjust the temperature in the reaction space.

## System setup theory:

The idea was to have a Raspberry PI and through the GPIO pins hook up the devices from an existing fermenter and access the device setting on a website. To do that, first I need to create the webservice and when thatâ€™s ready to test I need to build the actual device. As a product I want to give the code and documentation to the customer. They must buy their own devices for the system. I will create a guidebook on how to set up the hardware. On the customer side we will need to run python codes to control the bioreactor. On the server side the website must communicate with the database. We can set the current state we want for the controllers in the database. From there the locally running python codes can give feedback to the server and the customer will be able to see the current state of their device on the website.
In theory the website works separately from the local python codes, but they relate to using the same database.

## Tools:

Designed on Apple Macbook Air M1 (2020) and PC on Windows 10 (latest version) and will be tested on Raspberry PI 5 8GB.

## Used packages:

- git
- node.js
- express.js
